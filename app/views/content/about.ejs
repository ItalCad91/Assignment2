      Hello! My name is Riccardo and I enjoy creating website,applications, and
      things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started
      back in 2014 when I decided to try creating my first e-commerce website â€”
      turns out i enjoyed learning how to develop web pages better then doing
      business ðŸŽ‰.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutp">
      Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to study software
      engineering in College. My main focus these days is building accessible,
      inclusive websites and small applications to further develop my skills.
