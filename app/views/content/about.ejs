      Hello! My name is Riccardo and I enjoy creating website,applications, and
      things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started
      back in 2014 when I decided to create my first e-commerce website â€”
      turns out i enjoyed learning how to develop web pages better then doing business.
      Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to study software engineering in College. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive websites and small applications to further develop my skills. ðŸŽ‰ Skills Include:
      <br>
      â€¢ HTML  â€¢ CSS  â€¢ JavaScript â€¢ NodeJS â€¢ MongoDB â€¢ Express â€¢ Angular
